Run a model likelihood with the radiation model. First need to load the population density, the S matrix and the set of contacts that compatible. Once I have a definite set of three that are, I need to make an object that captures the three of them and then work that through the rest of the code. Or I just need to add a validate function for the triples with lots of comments. That might be quicker and easier.

```{r}
dim(gz_pop_raster)
```
